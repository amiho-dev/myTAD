# Ban Appeal & Support Information

## If Your Account Has Been Banned

### What Does This Mean?
Your account and device have been restricted from accessing myTAD. This typically means:
- Your account violated our Terms of Service
- Your device was associated with rule-breaking activity
- An admin has applied this restriction

### What You See
When you try to login, you'll see:
```
⛔
Your access has been restricted until:
[Date, Hour and Time until unlocked]

⚠️ Warning:
Creating a new account will result in all of your accounts 
being permanently banned, and your device will not be able 
to access myTAD.
```

### How Device Bans Work
The system identifies you by:
- Your **IP Address**
- Your **Device Fingerprint** (browser + operating system characteristics)

This means:
- **You cannot login** from your current device
- **You cannot register** a new account from your current device
- **You cannot bypass** this by:
  - Clearing cookies/cache
  - Using incognito mode
  - Using a different browser
  - Using different email addresses

### Why Can't I Just Create a New Account?
Creating a new account from a banned device will:
1. Immediately ban that new account too
2. Make all your accounts permanently banned
3. Permanently block your device from myTAD

**Don't attempt this.** The warning is real.

## Types of Bans

### Temporary Ban ⏱️
- **Duration**: You'll see the exact date and time you can access again
- **What happens**: Your account and device are locked until that time
- **Can you use a different device?** 
  - **Maybe**, depending on why you were banned
  - If you share an IP with other accounts, that IP is blocked
  - Admins use judgment for device sharing (family/workplace)

### Permanent Ban ⛔
- **Duration**: Indefinite
- **What happens**: Your account and device are permanently restricted
- **Can you appeal?** 
  - Yes, see "Appealing a Ban" below

## Appealing a Ban

### Permanent Ban Appeal Process
If you believe your ban was unfair:

1. **Document your case**: 
   - Why you believe the ban was a mistake
   - Any mitigating circumstances
   - Any evidence supporting your case

2. **Contact support**:
   - Email: [support email]
   - Include:
     - Your banned username
     - Brief explanation
     - Your evidence

3. **Appeal review**:
   - Admins will review your case
   - Response typically within 5-7 business days
   - You'll receive a decision

4. **If approved**:
   - Your account and device bans are lifted
   - You can login normally
   - You may receive a warning about future conduct

### Temporary Ban Appeal
If you believe your temporary ban was in error:
- You can appeal, but waiting out the ban may be faster
- If ban is short-term (< 24 hours), it's usually faster to just wait

## Preventing Future Bans

### Follow the Rules
- Read and understand the Terms of Service
- Don't engage in:
  - Cheating or exploiting glitches
  - Harassment or abuse
  - Account sharing (except family devices)
  - Spam or botting
  - Hacking attempts

### Be Honest with Support
- If you accidentally broke a rule, admit it
- This shows good faith for future appeals
- First-time violations often get mercy

### Protect Your Account
- Use a strong, unique password
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Don't share your login credentials
- Report suspicious account activity

## Different Devices & Accounts

### If You Share a Device
Family or workplace devices may have multiple accounts:
- If one account is banned, others on **same IP** may also be restricted
- Contact support to explain device sharing
- Admins can sometimes whitelist shared devices

### If You Use Multiple Devices
Different devices = different fingerprints and IPs:
- Ban affects only the device it was applied to
- You can use other devices (unless IP is shared)
- Contact support if all devices are blocked
